<h1> Hi, there! </h1>

<p> Fascinated by technological solutions, I am currently a student of the Computer Engineering course at Centro de Inform√°tica - UFPE</p>  
    
<p> I'm always looking to improve my knowledge about technologies, and currently I have academic experiences and personal projects with Java, JavaScript, C, python and Haskel programming languages. I also have knowledge about HTML, CSS, and Play Framework in a more web-oriented context.
